# Weather-Dashboard

* We created a dashboard using API Urls. Both of them are from the same server however the parameters we added in the url made all the difference. We query selected all five day forecast and the current temperature humidity wind speed and UV index for each city user puts in.

* We then gave each the date using moment.js and applied local storage to save our input as an array. We also created the button so when the user search for a city it gets saved at the bottom and the user can get back to that city just by clicking on that created element called buttton
